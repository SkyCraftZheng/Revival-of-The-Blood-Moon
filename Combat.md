A **round** of combat ends when the players agree to end their turns. The enemies never make rolls, they act in when players fail a roll and inflict consequences on the player characters.

At the end of the players turn, the environment and opponents have a chance to act. 

### What can you do in a round?
- Move a set distance, usually 30 ft but that is not set in stone. Whatever makes sense in the situation and allows the players to get in on the fun!
- Use abilities, how many? As many as you want! As long as you have the resources to cast them. Don't forget [**The Heat of Battle**](Blood%20Witch.md)!
- Interact with objects, performing simple actions, talk

### 0 Blood!!? in Combat
- When you reach 0 Blood in a combat situation, you do not go unconscious or have any impediment on your actions, except that you can no longer use abilities that require Blood. The heat of battle keeps keeps you alive.
- However, if all of you reach 0 Blood, you all die a Blood death at once.
