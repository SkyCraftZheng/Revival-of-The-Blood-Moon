A **round** of combat ends when the players agree to end their turn. The players plan out their turn and make rolls associated with their actions. The enemies never make rolls, they act in when players fail a roll and inflict consequences on the player characters.

The player characters are competent super soldiers. They can never fail their actions on their own, only when the opposing characters seriously outmanoeuvres them. This means if an action has a roll and the player fails the roll, it's not that they miss or fail to cast a spell, it's that their enemies reacted fast enough to do something that complicates the situation.
- DON'T take away from your players. For example, Adam uses Strike and fails his roll, don't simply say that he misses or the enemy just dodges out of the way.
- DO put a twist on their actions. Using the previous example, Adam punches straight through the soldier who grabs their hand and flexes every inch of their body, locking his hand in an iron vice. The other soldier takes this chance to land a clean shot on Adam, blowing a hole into his arm, take D6 Blood damage. Adam is now stuck, he can either remain where he is until the end of the next turn or tear of his arm and regrow it for D6 Blood.

After the players have decided what they do for the turn and rolled for the actions, narrate how their failed rolls deviates them from their plan. It is assumed that the players plan plays out in a matter of seconds, meaning that there is no time to react and change it once it is in motion.
- DON'T prevent players from carrying out their plan for the turn! Then they'll have to redo some of their turns! For example Alice and Bob decide that she will use Blood Jet to mark a soldier and Mark to mark a stone to throw over the cliff, while Bob will cease the moment to use Blood Warp to swap the position of the soldier and the stone as it flies into the abyss. All the rolls are over the TARGET, except Blood Jet.  DON'T narrate Alice's failed roll on Blood Jet as missing the soldier, then their plan will fall apart! What will Bob do? Why would Alice then mark a stone and throw it over a cliff?
- DO let their plans succeed with unforeseen consequences. Using the previous example, the soldier in the moment of hesitation from Alice, intuiting the Alice's and Bob's trick, pulls out a rope. As soon as he is swapped over the edge, he lasso's the rope onto Alice, now Alice is being dragged over to the cliff's edge. Next turn if something is not done, Alice will fall off the cliff due the soldier's weight!

Finally, reposition the enemies, remember they can only move as much as the players!
### What can you do in a round?
- Move a set distance, usually 30 ft but that is not set in stone. Whatever makes sense in the situation and allows the players to get in on the fun!
- Use abilities, how many? As many as you want! As long as you have the resources to cast them. Don't forget [**The Heat of Battle**](Blood%20Witch.md)!
- Interact with objects, performing simple actions, talk

### 0 Blood!!? in Combat
- When you reach 0 Blood in a combat situation, you do not go unconscious or have any impediment on your actions, except that you can no longer use abilities that require Blood. The heat of battle keeps keeps you alive.
- However, if all of you reach 0 Blood, you all die a Blood death at once.
