*"You are servants of the Blood Moon, notorious unstoppable fighters. That is not due to your strength or wit alone, but the fact that you always come back. Dying is not that bad for you, you can be brought back by your fellow servants of the Blood Moon and in the worst case by the Blood Moon that comes once a month. That is if you're soul remains intact.*

*It's been centuries since you were called upon by the Blood Moon. You rise to a world completely alien to the one you've once helped create. Humans have found a way to enslave the monsters of the Blood Moon. And these humans, did they do so with good will? Of course not. Your brethren are used for war and oppression. **Oh it makes your blood boil** and you reminds of why you swore loyalty to the Blood Moon.*

***Destroy the humans and their monsters***"

### Starting stats:
[Soul Strain](Soul%20Strain.md) 0, Blood 10, normal [Temperature](Temperature.md),
STR 0, DEX 0, CON 0, WIS 0, INT 0, CHA 0, distribute +6

### Rolling:
Whenever the GM calls for a roll, you roll with a number of D6s equal to the appropriate stat, strength for brute force, dexterity for finesse and swift tasks etc. Each D6 that rolls a 4 or above, counts as a success. You need to roll successes equal or above the Target obstacle to succeed.

A dice pool of 0, means automatic failure

Target obstacle per situation (ICRPG style, Hard meaning +1 Obstacle and Easy -1 Obstacle)

A failed check should not mean a straight failure in game, that would be no fun because you are meant fail checks! Failed check is a success with a complication or a failure with a silver lining. You pick the door and as you open it it creaks like a bastard, the guards are alerted! In combat, this means you hit the guard in the jugular, but you've left an opening for another guard to retaliate! Or as you go to strike the guard, they use their shield to block your attack avoiding damage, but you punch straight through rendering the shield useless!

A successful check should be difficult and more scarce than the alternative. But when it does happen, it's glorious, you succeed at no cost. You pick that door without a sound goes exactly how you intended it to.
### Stat advancement:
Whenever you roll against an Obstacle equal to or higher than your stat, gain a point of XP in that stat. Once you have XP equal to your stat, your stat increases and your XP resets to 0 in that stat.

### Gaining abilities:
When appropriate determined by the GM, like winning a combat and drinking the blood of your enemies, you can gain an additional ability. You get choose between a Blood Rite, a Blood Curse and a Blood Sacrifice that are determined randomly.

### Two types of death:
Blood and Soul
- Blood Death: Your soul can cling onto one Blood Ability. Your fellow servants of the Blood Moon can perform a minute long ritual to provide you with a new living body, a Blood Moon will have a similar effect. You regain all your abilities upon consuming the blood of your old body.
	- This happens whenever you reach 0 Blood outside of combat or when all of the PCs reach 0 Blood in combat.
	- Whenever you die a Blood Death, you don't forget the people you've tasted the blood of before, and those that have ingested your blood still have drank your blood.
- Soul Death: You are permanently dead
	- (Currently, only a severe fallout can cause this)
