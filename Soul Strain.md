Range: 0-6
Sometimes when you fail a roll the GM may ask you to roll the Die of Fate, a D6. If you roll above your number of Soul Strain, nothing happens. If you roll equal or below, you've tested fate and now suffer the consequences, you incur Fallout.

0-2: Minor Fallout
3-5: Moderate Fallout
6: Severe Fallout

After incurring fallout, you lose 2 Soul Strain for minor, 4 for moderate and 6 for severe.
